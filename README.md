# Java OOP Concepts Project

### Overview

This project is focused on demonstrating key **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts using **Java**. The aim is to provide a practical example of how OOP principles such as **inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation**, and **abstraction** can be implemented in a real-world scenario.

You can clone this repository, explore the code, make your changes, and practice applying OOP principles. Contributions and improvements are always welcome!

### Key Concepts Covered:
1. **Encapsulation** – Example provided for data hiding and access control using getters and setters.
2. **Inheritance** – Demonstrated with a parent-child class relationship.
3. **Polymorphism** – Showcased both compile-time and runtime polymorphism through method overloading and overriding.
4. **Abstraction** – Achieved via abstract classes and interfaces to define common behaviors.

### How to Contribute:
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/java-oop-project.git

Explore the code and practice OOP concepts in Java.
Make any changes or improvements you'd like.
Submit a pull request (PR) with your changes. I'd love to see any feedback or comments on the OOP implementation.

**Installation and Running the Project:**
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/java-oop-project.git
```

2. Open the project in your favorite Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse).
3. Run the main class to see the output of the OOP examples.
